# Pattern-Recognition-Labs

This repository contains implementations of core machine learning algorithms covered in the Pattern Recognition course.

## ðŸ“š Algorithms Implemented

### ðŸ”¹ Supervised Learning
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Logistic Regression
- Neural Networks (NN)
- Bagging
- Boosting
- Decision Trees

### ðŸ”¹ Unsupervised Learning & Dimensionality Reduction
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- K-Means Clustering
- Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)
- Autoencoders

## Course Context
These labs are part of the **Pattern Recognition** coursework and aim to provide hands-on experience with the theory and implementation of both supervised and unsupervised learning methods.
